    <h2>About Us</h2>
<h3>Who are we?</h3> 
<p>At Events by Ray founded by <strong>Daniel Onyinye Emmanuella.</strong> We’re more than just event planners 
   we’re memory-makers. Founded with a passion for bringing joy to every moment, we’ve helped countless
    clients host stress-free, stylish, and meaningful events.

<br>What started as a simple love for decorating and organizing small gatherings quickly grew into a full-scale 
brand driven by creativity, reliability, and excellence. Whether it's an intimate dinner, a grand wedding, or a corporate launch, 
our goal is always the same: to create an experience that leaves a lasting impression.

<br>We believe that every event tells a story 
 and we’re here to help you tell yours with elegance, precision, and heart.
  From concept to clean-up, our team brings fresh ideas, trusted vendors, and hands-on coordination to ensure everything goes off without a hitch.

<br>With Events by Ray, you don’t just get an event 
 you get peace of mind, personalized service, and unforgettable moments.                                   </p>
